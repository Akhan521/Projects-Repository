Rules of Checkers:

Checkers is a 2-player game that is played on an 8 x 8 board. Each player will be given
12 pieces. These pieces can be either red or black. The pieces will be placed on the
board in a certain manner. Pieces can only move diagonally forward. You are NOT allowed
to move your pieces vertically or horizontally. 

The goal of the game is to capture all of your opponent's game pieces. 
In the event that you capture all of your opponent's pieces, you will be announced 
the winner of the round. 

In order to capture pieces, you have to "jump" opponent pieces. 
To jump a piece, the square after the piece you'll be capturing must be empty. You will 
move your piece into the square that is after the piece you'll be capturing and take your 
opponent's piece. Moreover, if you are able to jump multiple pieces, you must jump all 
capturable pieces during your turn. If you can capture more than one piece, you'll be 
given the option to choose which piece you'd like to capture. 

If a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, it becomes a King piece that is capable 
of moving diagonally forward and backward. King pieces are allowed to move in either direction.
Capturing a King piece is the same as capturing regular pieces. 

If, during your turn, you have no legal moves to make, you will forfeit the game. If this is 
the case, your opponent will receive all of your pieces, hence, winning the game.
