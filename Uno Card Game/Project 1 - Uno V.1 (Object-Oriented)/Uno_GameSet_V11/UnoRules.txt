Rules for Uno:
The goal of the game is to match cards until either opponent runs out of cards.
Once a player finishes their deck of cards, the game ends and they win.
You can match cards either by color, value, or have a chance to sabotage your opponent by drawing
wild cards, draw 1's, or draw 2's. A wild card can be used to set a new color to match.
A draw 1 forces the opponent to draw 1 card, and a draw 2 works in a similar manner.
Wild cards can be used at anytime. However, draw 1's and 2's can only be used when colors match
or when the card that needs to be matched is also a draw 1/2 card.
